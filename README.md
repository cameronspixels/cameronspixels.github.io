# Hello

While my live, completed projects are on my portfolio website, I'll link below anything that I'm currently working on.

## Websites
[Bromsgrove Body Repairs](https://cameronspixels.github.io/BBR)

In an almost final state, I'm working with the client and another developer to ready the site for launch.

## Projects
[Responsive Photography Grids](https://cameronspixels.github.io/photo--grids)

An example stock photography portfolio developed using responsive CSS grids. Try it at different widths!
