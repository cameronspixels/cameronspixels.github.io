## Projects
These are mock websites which are largely fun projects, ensuring that I've always got something a little different to do. I'll come back and add something to one or the other when I get an itch for developing.

[Spark Manchester](https://cameronspixels.github.io/sparkmanchester)

* A mock website for a Manchester-based web agency.

[A Barber Shop](https://cameronspixels.github.io/barbur)
